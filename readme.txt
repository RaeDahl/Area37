Description: You and your best friend have always been fascinated
by urban legends and stories of the paranormal. The forest near your quiet
college town is surrounded by stories of strange sightings and mysterious
disappearances. For months, you've been planning to use this 3-day weekend
to explore it together, but you got sick right before, so you decide to
send your friend without you while you help them out over the phone. You've 
completely lost your voice though, so you can only text in response to the
things they describe.

Improvements:
Items and exits are now separate classes
There are now characters with their own dialogue
Some areas can only be unlocked by completing in-game objectives
A time system exists and certain events can only be triggered at certain times of day
There are status effects that can alter the game's behavior (hasBike and paranoid)

How to play:
Explore the area. Look at things, talk to people, wander around, and enjoy the 
slightly spooky ambience.

You have a total of 3 in-game "days" to play, although the game can end before then.
Each "day" consists of 4 5-minute long time blocks: dawn, midday, dusk, and night.
Some events can only happen during certain times.
After three days, the narrator character has to go home, and the game ends.

type 'go', followed by a direction, to go to a new area
type 'look', followed by an item, to take a closer look at it
type 'take', followed by an item, to pick something up
type 'drop', followed by an item, to remove an item from my bag
type 'use', followed by an item, to use that object
type 'talk', followed by a person, to talk to them
type 'list inventory', to get a list of everything in your inventory
type 'describe area' or 'describe room', to get a description of the area
type 'help' in case you need this list again

Due to time constraints, this is mostly a demo version of what I'd like to
eventually make into a much larger game. For now, the main goal is to get
the bike so you can go to the town. The town does not exist in the code yet,
so this is where the game ends. In a finished version, the goal would be to
play the game multiple times and collect all the possible endings.
